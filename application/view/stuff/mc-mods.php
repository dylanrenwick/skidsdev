<h1>How to install MC Mods with Prism</h1>
<p><a class="active-link" href="https://prismlauncher.org">Prism Launcher</a> is an open-source, free-to-use Minecraft launcher that allows you to easily install mods, even if you have no idea what you're doing.
<br/>The images below are all taken on Windows 11, however Prism provides full support for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. It's even supported on Steam Deck! For linux users, it's available as an Appimage, a Flatpak on Flathub, or a portable app.</p>
<p>Once you've installed Prism, you'll be prompted to log in to your Microsoft account. Be sure to use the same account you use to play Minecraft.</p>
<br/>
<p>Now, simply create a new instance with the "Add Instance" button. Prism instances make it easy to maintain multiple installations of Minecraft with different mods and even game versions. Hello LondON currently uses:<pre>Minecraft v1.21.4</pre></p>
<p>When you click Add Instance, you'll be presented with this screen:</p>

<p>In addition to selecting the right game version, make sure to also select your desired Mod Loader in the bottom right corner.<br/>If you're unsure, I strongly recommend Fabric for playing on vanilla servers.</p>
<p>Once you select a Mod Loader, it will load a list of versions for the loader. You can safely take the recommended version (the one with the gold star, usually the top one).<br/>Then, click OK.</p>
<br/>
<p>Now, select your new instance, and click "Edit" on the right of Prism. This will open the instance settings seen below.</p>

<p>Switch to the "Mods" tab on the left, and then click "Download mods" on the right, as seen below.</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UR9xzhm.png" style="max-width:50%;" alt="Prism Download Mods" /> <br/>
<p>This opens the Download mods window, which allows you to search for mods across multiple different sources. As of writing, Prism only supports downloading mods from Modrinth and CurseForge. Most mods should be available on both, and I generally strongly recommend preferring Modrinth when you have the option, as it's a fully free, open-source, community-run mod platform.</p>
<p>Once you've found the mods you would like to install in the list, double-click them and they will display bold and underlined, as seen below:</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nqxHmj6.png" style="max-width:50%;" alt="Prism Install Mods" />
<p><i>See that Sodium is both bolded and underlined, indicating it is selected for install.</i></p> <br/>
<p>Once you've selected all the mods you want to install, click "Review and confirm" in the bottom right corner. This will open a small dialog listing the exact mods that will be installed, including any dependencies of mods you've selected. Hit OK and Prism will download and install all the mods for you!</p>
<p><i><b>Note:</b> Some mods on CurseForge do not allow 3rd party downloads, preventing Prism from downloading them for you. In this case, Prism will provide you a list of all the blocked mods, along with links directly to the download pages of each mod. Simply click all the links and visit all the pages in your browser to download the mods. Prism will detect them in your downloads folder and automatically install them.</i></p>
<br/>
<p>Once all the mods are installed, you can launch the instance to launch Minecraft with your mods. Enjoy!</p>
<p>Additionally, you may notice that beneath the "Mods" tab in the Instance Settings, there are "Resource packs" and "Shader packs" tabs. These work exactly the same as the mods tab and make installing texture packs or shaders a breeze!</p>
<br/>
<h2>Not sure what mods to install?</h2>
